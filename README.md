# Markit - The Reddit clone portfolio site

Made a fun website to show who I am. It was also a fun way to learn Vue, which I must say is rather smashing.

### Development

To develop on this personal portfolio site, I decided to try out Vue.js. I had never used Vue before, but it was fun to experiment and play around. You can use the following steps to get the site running locally:

- Run:

```
npm run serve
```

- The application will begin running at the following URL: resume.test:8080

### Deployment

The deployment for this site is run through Github pages. To keep it simple, I included a deployment script that you can find in the scripts folder in the project. The script is called gh-pages-deploy.js

To run the script and deploy the site to Github Pages, all you need to do is run:

```
npm run gh-pages-deploy
```

I hope you enjoy learning about all the fun jobs that I've had and the neat projects I've worked on!
